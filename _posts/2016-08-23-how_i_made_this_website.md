Here is a simple recipe for making a website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

1. Sign up for a [github account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) and login to your account
2. Browse the internet for a Jekyll theme you like:
  + [http://jekyllthemes.org/](http://jekyllthemes.org/)
  + [https://jekyllthemes.io/](https://jekyllthemes.io/)
  + [http://themes.jekyllrc.org/](http://themes.jekyllrc.org/)
3. Once you find a nice theme, go to the github repository for that theme. Here's the one I used to create this site (thank you [Taylan Tatli](http://taylantatli.me/!): [https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Halve](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Halve)
4. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button:
![Github Fork Button](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)
When you click the "Fork" button you should see something like this:
![Github Fork Gif](https://help.github.com/assets/images/site/fork-a-repo.gif)
You've basically just copied the repository into your github account. Nice work!
5. Open you newly forked repository and click the "Settings" tab

6. In the "Repository Name" field, type: yourusername.github.io (replace "yourusername" with your github username) and click "Rename"
7. Now if you navigate to https://yourusername.github.io, you should see a copy of the website that you forked. Now you just need to customize it. _I say "just", but this can be the most time-intensive part. If you're anything like me, then you could spend days, weeks, even years tweaking little style\*\* or usability things. The next step at least gives you a place to start._
8. Most Jekyll themes can be customized by editing the "_config.yml" file. There are three ways to do this:
  + editing the _config.yml file direcly in the browser at github.com
  + using a third party github content editor like [Prose](http://prose.io/) by Development Seed, or
  + cloning your repository locally, making changes, and pushing them to your github repository ([Atlassian has a guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics) on this)
